The following brief resulted from an interview by IRIDeS editorial as an introduction of my research.
In a very altruistic vein, and not at all self-serving, I share it here to fill my empty page.
# Modeling medical rescue activities during a major disaster
In the acute phase following a major disaster, special workers, including Disaster Medical Assistance
Team (DMAT) members, firefighters, police officers, and Self-Defense Force members, urgently and
collaboratively take actions to rescue disaster victims, assess the severity of injuries (triage), and
transport injured individuals to appropriate medical facilities as needed. Using agent simulation, I
am currently working on research to model these medical rescue activities during the acute phase of
a disaster.
Agent simulation is a method that mathematically and statistically reproduces the behavior and
decision-making of agents (individuals with specific roles). It allows us to visualize the complex
movements that arise when diverse agents act independently and interact with each other. We can
also analyze what happens when conditions change.
My current research has a scenario where a trench-type earthquake and tsunami hit a wide area,
including Sendai City. I set workers involved in the emergency rescue activities, who perform their
respective roles, as different agents, to simulate how each agent acts and communicates with each
other, as well as how the overall activities change depending on the location of key facilities (such as
a Staging Care Unit).
Dr Erick Mas (Associate Professor at Disaster Geo-informatics) has already made a conceptual model of the movements and
communication systems of those agents. I am working on implementing this conceptual one into a
model that takes into account actual geographical conditions (which have physical constraints such
as road conditions). In this model, for example, to look for survivors, firefighters will make a
decision to go to a location where it is more certain that it is most damaged. Firefighters who have
found an injured individual communicate with DMAT. DMAT members perform triage and contact a
medical facility to transport the person as necessary. This model includes all these countless actions,
decisions, and message exchanges. 
Each simulation can be run stochastically hence we can capture the probabilistic nature of the
evacuation dynamics, through repeated simulation, even without perturbing the initial conditions.
Through Bayesian inference, we can then capture the uncertainty of the system and interrogate the
model to identify both systemic and policy issues.
ã€€Once this simulation model is complete, it will enable capturing an entire emergency medical
rescue activity following a disaster. It will be able to show what bottlenecks current systems have, if
any, and how the entire operations would change if factors such as personnel deployment and
locations of key facilities, such as hospitals and staging care units, change. The model can be applied
to other regions, including Kochi, and become a versatile model usable nationwide.
