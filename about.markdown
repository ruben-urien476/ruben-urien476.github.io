I'm Ruben, 
I like reading, cooking, and video games.

I'm currently assistant professor at the International Research Institute of Disaster Science, Tohoku University.


I work on social system complexity in disasters. 
Most of what I do leverages graph theory, topology, bayesian machine learning, and computational social psychology to build agent models that we can study in order to improve the systems we employ in disaster management.
